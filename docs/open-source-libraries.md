## Open-source libraries used by Source
Source wouldn't exist without a number of wonderful open-source tools and projects, including:

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), simply the best web-development framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
* [django-environ](http://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for using environment variables to store project secrets like database locations and API passwords.
* [django-haystack](http://haystacksearch.org/), for indexing content and standing up a search engine with [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) underneath.
* [django-lockdown](https://github.com/Dunedan/django-lockdown), for password-protecting a development site (which sometimes you have to do quickly after accidentally pushing out the staging URL in a live RSS feed).
* [django-sesame](http://django-sesame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for passwordless login via magic link over email.
* [django-storages](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for interacting with Amazon S3 to store media files.
* [django-taggit](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for adding some taxonomy.
* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), because why in the world would you make HTTP requests via Python any other way.
* [sorl-thumbnail](https://sorl-thumbnail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), letting templates define the auto-cropped image sizes they need.
* [tyopgrify](https://github.com/mintchaos/typogrify), for smart-quoting, widow-killing, and other little things that lead to nicer typography.
* [whitenoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/), for serving static files simply in production.
